The latest release of MODX Revolution is a minor version upgrade to 2.4.0. This release adds package dependencies along with over 70 improvements. <br />
<br />
Highlights are listed below, but check out the <a href="https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modxcms/revolution/v2.4.0-pl/core/docs/changelog.txt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">changelog</a> for the play-by-play. <ul class="dis-ul"> <li>Package Dependencies! Developers can now specify dependencies for their MODX Extras. This is a way bigger deal than can be decribed here.

</li>
<li>Some improvements have been made to the accessibility of the Manager UI. We&#039;ve got a ways to go yet, but this version sets the stage better than any previous version. <br />
</li>
<li>Heroic and necessary steps were taken towards making MODX fully <strong>testable</strong>, thanks to @markwillis82. <br />
</li>
<li>Everyone loves performance optimization, and new database indexes in 2.4 deliver the warm fuzzies. <br />
</li>
<li>Better UX, stability, security and overall goodness abound. <br />
</li>
<li>Again, for the full (and rather long) list, read <a href="https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modxcms/revolution/v2.4.0-pl/core/docs/changelog.txt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this</a>. </li></ul> <br />
<br />
<strong>Important:</strong> <br />
Revolution 2.3.6 contained a security patch and is considered a mandatory update. Revolution 2.4.0 contains all same patches from 2.3.6, and also closes the same security issue. <br />

This patch release follows two days after the release of Revo 2.3.4 to correct an issue causing problems with sorting the Resource tree via drag and drop. We also squeezed in a couple more fixes. Why wouldn&#039;t we? I missed posting on the day of release of 2.3.4 and held off until 2.3.5 was released to publish the announcement so here&#039;s a combined announcement that includes details of both patch releases. Most of the major improvements were in the 2.3.4 release. Read on to find out more. <br />
<br />
Here&#039;s the list of changes in Revo 2.3.5: <br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><li>Fix drag and drop Resource sort when auto_isfolder setting is enabled </li>
<li>Fix Account drop down hover on small screens </li>
<li>Compile Sass with libsass </li>
<li>Update npm packages </li>
<li>Update and Relax bower packages View the <a href="https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modxcms/revolution/v2.3.5-pl/core/docs/changelog.txt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">changelog</a>. </li></ul>

<br />
Revolution 2.3.4 included two dozen fixes, many of which are bugfixes and refinements to the Manager. Here are the highlights:<br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><li>Fixes to custom manager themes </li>
<li>Fix editing Amazon S3 Media sources </li>
<li>Quick update form, now displays the Resource pagetitle or Element name rather than just &quot;Quick Update&quot;. </li>
<li>Update Font Awesome to 4.3.0 </li>
<li>Update bower package for correctly building Manager themes </li>
<li>Correctly apply Resource locks to current user </li>

This patch release follows two days after the release of Revo 2.3.4 to correct an issue causing problems with sorting the Resource tree via drag and drop. We also squeezed in a couple more fixes. Why wouldn&#039;t we? I missed posting on the day of release of 2.3.4 and held off until 2.3.5 was released to publish the announcement so here&#039;s a combined announcement that includes details of both patch releases. Most of the major improvements were in the 2.3.4 release. Read on to find out more. <br />
<br />
Here&#039;s the list of changes in Revo 2.3.5: <br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><li>Fix drag and drop Resource sort when auto_isfolder setting is enabled </li>
<li>Fix Account drop down hover on small screens </li>
<li>Compile Sass with libsass </li>
<li>Update npm packages </li>

The previous official MODXpo was hosted in <a href="http://2013.modxpo.eu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">November 2013 in Cologne, Germany</a>. After a year hiatus (though not without an awesome MODX conference in between), web designer and MODX Ambassador, <a href="http://www.bdcreative-design.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Benjamin Davis</a>, has taken the reins as chief organizer for the next official MODXpo with major help from the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/MODX-Muenchen/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Munich Meetup Group</a> and other <a href="http://modx.com/ambassadors" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Ambassadors</a>. <br />

MODXpo is an international conference for people who build websites with, and use MODX. Sessions include presentations and workshops for both a beginner and seasoned pro. Everyone who attends a MODXpo comes away filled with new perspectives for solving business or clients&#039; problems. There&#039;s nothing like it. <br />
<br />
<strong>Host Sponsors Kochan &amp; Partner</strong><br />
The catalyst for MODXpo 2015 was the Munich-based agency, and MODX fans, Kochan &amp; Partner. They graciously offered to host the event in their 200 person capacity hall. <a href="http://www.kochan.de/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kochan &amp; Partner</a> have been long-time MODX users and host the local MODX meetups in Munich. <br />
<br />
<strong>Ideas and Voices</strong><br />
No conference would be complete without interesting topics and speakers. The organizers would like as much input as possible for shaping MODXpo 2015 into the best conference it can be. The organizing team is seeking your ideas on interesting talks and are looking for proposals from anyone in the MODX community who is interested in sharing some of how they work. <a href="https:/docs.google.com/forms/d/1TZXJ3upiYEjCzBvq0uPM4VPaNvCI7NtEGqFEk0qQ2nM/viewform" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Submit your topic ideas</a>. <br />

Even if you&#039;ve never spoken at an event before but have solved some problems in an interesting way for your business, your clients or just built something cool. That&#039;s all you need to start building your talk. <a href="https:/docs.google.com/forms/d/1dJDaWm9hTLfkyrkpLjlAiLqB09eWUcwbgJdHOQdcBPo/viewform" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apply to speak at MODXpo 2015.</a> <br />
<br />
<strong>Call for Sponsors</strong><br />
Of course an event of this size cannot rely only on a single host sponsor, as nice as the team at Kochan &amp; Partner are. We&#039;d like to partner with some awesome organizations who are looking to support the MODX event or put their brand in front of the MODX community at large. <a href="http://2015.modxpo.eu/#contact-form" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contact the MODXpo 2015 team</a> to ask about becoming a sponsor partner <br />

<br />
As you know, MODX has always stood for creative freedom. However, Revo’s Manager has failed to deliver that promise for all. People who use assistive technologies like screen readers, enlarged fonts and alternate input devices were never really given proper consideration. That must change. <br />
<br />
We want to make it right by making it possible for anyone to use MODX, no matter what. <br />

<strong>A Huge Head Start</strong><br />
We have already started research and development work on this important initiative thanks to $25,000 in funding from <a href="http://www.osu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Ohio State University</a>. We’re looking to complete the effort by crowdfunding a matching amount. If only 1000 MODX community members and their clients donated $25, we’d reach our goal, virtually overnight. You can <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/a11y" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">get directly involved</a>, too.<br />
 <br />
All funds raised will be used to dedicate development resources, expert consulting and user testing. <br />
 <br />
<strong>You Can Make a Difference</strong><br />
So please help us reach our goal so we can bring MODX to everyone. Take a minute (right now please!) to visit <a href="http://a11y.modx.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a11y.modx.com</a> and find the donation level that’s right for you. Any amount will make a difference, and it’s easy to support this very worthy cause. All donations over $25 are eligible for a variety of donor rewards including MODX stickers, shirts and hats exclusive to this campaign, and some really awesome Accessibility courses from <a href="https://dequeuniversity.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deque University</a>. <br />
<br />
<strong>Help Spread the Word</strong><br />
If you can’t support this initiative personally, but work with MODX professionally, we’d love to see your company or customers supporting the accessible MODX Manager project, too. It takes just a few seconds to forward this message along with a simple request from you.<br />

Revolution 2.2.14 was released today. This patch release contains numerous fixes and improvements including further security enhancements relating to the fixes in 2.2.13.
